<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The recorder is a woodwind instrument, made out of different types of wood. A recorder is probably best described as a wooden
    cylinder with holes in it. Often you can take a recorder apart into three parts. They come in different sizes, are in different keys 
    and play in different octaves. The smallest recorder is the Sporanino in F. After the Sopranino, in order from highest to lowest, 
    come the Descant in C, the Treble in F, the Tenor in C and the Bass in F. These are only the most common ones, there are also lower
    instruments, for example the Great Bass. To play the recorder you blow in the mouthpiece and cover up the holes with your fingers
    to play different notes.The recorder is very rarely used in an orchestra, since it is quite quiet. However, playing together with 
    other recorder players is a really nice experience! The different ranges of the different types of recorder make it possible to play
    in different octaves and creating a diverse range in a recorder ensemble.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The earliest flutes date back to the neolithic period.  They were depicted in paintings, sclptures and early manuscripts. In the 
    Renaissance, the recorder was one of the most important wind instruments. There are even some surviving instruments from that time.
    It was very common for the recorder to be played in churches and for nobility. Nobles of all sexes learned to play the recorder, 
    including Henry VII. The baroque period is considered to be the "golden age" of the recorder. Here the recorder developed from the 
    Renaissance recorder to the baroque recorder, and the recorder's size was standerdised for the first time. During this period, the 
    recorder was associated with funerals, marriages, miraculous events and other scenes. Important composors for the recorder who 
    lived during the time period are Johann Sebastian Bach, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann and others. During the Classic and 
    Romantik, the recorder wasn't used as much as previously. There is a big debate why. Reasons may inclue a lack of significant 
    class professional players, or just that the nature of the recorder wasn't appreciated any more. 
</p>
<h2>Recorders in the modern world</h2>
<p>After not being so popular in the Classic and Romantic, the recorder experienced a "revival" in the 20th century. This is often 
    attributed to Arnold Dolmetsch. The first recorders played in the modern period were antique instruments, but Arnold Dormetsch
    decided to make his own. These imitated the baroque recorders, but differed in structure. He also standerdised the double holes 
    for the sixth and seventh holes, something you still see in recorders today. <br>
    As mentioned before, the recorder is more a solo instrument than an orchestra instrument. However, it has been by popular music 
    groupes for pop songs. These groupes include The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin.

<h2>Different types of redcorder</h2>
<h2>Starting to learn the recorder</h2>
<p>If you would like to start learning the recorder, I would recoment starting with the descant. It is one of the easiest to start
    with, as the finger holes aren't spaced out so far (even littel children can reach) and it is not so high so you don't get earache 
    everytime you play it. You play the recorder with your left hand at the top. The thumb is on the thum hole (the single hole at the 
    back of the recorder). With the first three fingers of your left hand, you cover the first three holes. Then you set the fingers
    of your right hand on the recorder, so that all the holes are covered. That is the lowest note of the recorder (see finger chart 
    below). But I wouldn't recomend starting with the lowest note. It is often hard to get a nice sound out of it if you are new to the
    recorder. I think the recorder is brilliant for starting to learn an instrument because it is quite easy to produce
    a note and it is very hard to be out of tune. You can play simple tunes quite quickly without having to do much practice. <br>
    Things to watch out for when playing the recorder: <br>
    <b>Have I closed all the holes properly?:</b> <br>
    If for some reason you don't get a clear note out of the recorder, you should check if your fingers are covering the holes properly.
    This is especially important for the thumb hole. <br>
    <b>Am I blowing too much/too little?</b><br>
    If all of your holes are closed properly, and it still doesn't sound right, try experimenting with how much air you blow into your 
    recorder. If you are blowing too much air, sometimes the recorder can get squeaky quickly. This is often the case with higher
    recorders. Alternative, if you are blowing to little, it won't sound nice either. <br>
    <b>Is my recorder pushed together properly?</b>
    As mentioned in the description, the recorder can ofte be taken apart in three parts. It is important that these are pushed
    together properly before playing, otherwise your recorder won't be in tune anymore. It they are not pushed together properly, 
    the instrument will be lower than it should be. <br>
    If you follow this advice, there should be nothing stopping you from playing a recorder. You can also finde good books that
    introduce the notes step by step with easy pieces. <br>
    If you don't have a recorder yet but you want to start playing, you don't have to by a very expensive woodan one. There are some
    perfectly good plasic ones, especially if you don't plan on playing that much.
